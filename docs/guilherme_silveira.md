# Guilherme Silveira

These are **very basic** movements or perhaps **complex** combo effects (to be) implemented
so they can work as controls and effects.

## Four aces
> Freely cut 4 packets, all 4 top cards are aces, still retain control.
- Original author: Ed Marlo
- [FourAces]

## 4 aces poker, magician decision
> A single cut and 4 hands of poker are dealt, one of the hands gets the 4 aces
- N is defined by the magician between [4, 5, 6] fixed
- optionally use second dealing
- [IsAcesHand], [AcesHand]

## 4 aces poker, volunteer decision
> A single cut and N hands of poker are dealt, one of the hands gets the 4 aces
- N is defined by the volunteer between [4, 5, 6] fixed
- with or without second dealing
- to ask the audience for any custom hand would be too similar to the powerful

## Winning brazilian Truco

## The ace of minds
> The spectator distributes the cards into 4 piles. The most common card is shows... the 4 aces.
> It is unfair because the aces are the most common card. For example, Penelope pick the cards, like this?
> Find a fifth ace

## Generated: The 5 most common cards (the entire combo)
> The four aces (marlo-guilherme) then Generated Spelling (guilherme) then 
> Penny Wise Force all of them at once. Keep a PINKY BREAK AS to show something
> four aces in one side, spellingon the other side. 

## Secret Agent
> Volunteer picks a number for the agent and does not say it (007).
> Counts the cards into a new stack. Peek the agent. Puts the stack back.

> the magician know about it so they can spell it and get to the card

- [IsImpromptuSpelled], [ImpromptuSpelled]

## Impromptu Name a card number
- If in the beginning of a trick with 'name a card' requirement, a card named is at the position
  of the spelling or number, just count it
  
## All kinds of dealing hands
- with or without second and bottom dealing
- custom or required number of players

## Palindrome finder
- When a volunteer is a palindrome (Ana), choose her
- Cut to a card, show a palindrome

## Impromptu Destination Stack
- Based on Destination Stack from Woody Aragon Memorandum
- Having a previously chosen card at a specific position, find a spelling or counting card, guess it, wrong? Well, lets spell/count it

## Daniel Prado's Peregrine Pass - Guilherme's Control
> Cards are spread face up, the deck is closed again.
> Used as a cut to any card (as a pass with no chosen card).
