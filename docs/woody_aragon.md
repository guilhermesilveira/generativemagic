## Memorandum

1. Breather convincer

Based on Eric Mead's "The Tangled Web" (from Woody Aragon Memorandum):
> Even the best false shuffles will hardly remove the idea of a stacked deck from the mind of a spectator who wanders
> *why the card on the face of the pack is always the same one*.

3. Breather Crimper
