## In His pocket
> Three cards from the top are shown. The volunteer thinks of one. You put them into your pocket, and bring
> back two of them to the deck. The volunteer names the card. Thats the card in your pocket.
- Guilherme variation for implementation: they do not need to come from the top
- Convincer issue: why bring all cards to the pocket? There must be a valid reason for that.

## Knock Out Speller
> Cards are spread. A spectator removes and puts back the card into its position.
> The deck is picked up, cut. Spells, counting to the matching card.

Guilherme issue
> Manipulating the deck after openly knowing the card name gives away the control.
> Still, it can be used since it requires no complex moves. A better approach is to use
> Daniel Prado's peregrine pass.
> Second deal can be used to not remove cards.

# Not interested for implementation

The following effects have simpler versions to achieve the same result.

## New Card Discovery
> A card is selected and put back on top. The cards are spread and the selected one is learned or revealed.
- Guilherme: The recognition method is simplified with the use of a single key card.

## Odd or Even
> Jordan
> Generalization by Guilherme Silveira:
> 13 (or more) cards where the information regarding odd/even of the previous 4 tells you which one was picked.
