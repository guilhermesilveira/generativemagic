## The Fan Prediction
> A chosen card is written down and put back. A second card is selected, all but it is reversed.
> A fan is made, the second card is the same as the first one.
- The issue with method is that there is no reason a magician would reverse the deck but the selected card,
  a real magician would reverse the card, not the other cards.
  We need a well contextualized excuse for doing that.
